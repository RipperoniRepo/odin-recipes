        </li>
        <li>
            1 oz shredded mozzarella
        </li>
        <li>
            garlic salt and pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon flour
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon butter
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Adjust oven rack to top position and preheat to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wash and dry produce. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise then slice crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick half-moons.
        </li>
        <li>
            Halve tomato lengthwise then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick half-moons.
        </li>
        <li>
            Peel garlic and place cloves in the center of a small piece of foil. Drizzle with 1 tsp olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cinch into a packet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss zucchini on a baking sheet with a 1 tsp drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp of the italian seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste. Place garlic foil packet on same sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast veggies on top rack until zucchini is browned and tender, 12-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the veggies roast, place tomato slices in a medium bowl and toss with another 1 tsp of the italian seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once zucchini is tender, transfer to bowl with tomato and toss to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully wipe any excess oil off the baking sheet while keeping the garlic packet on it. Place flatbreads on sheet and return to top rack until the flatbreads are lightly toasted and garlic is softened, 5-7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, melt 1 TBSP butter in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp italian seasoning, and 1 TBSP flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk constantly until lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium-low.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk in 1/2 C water and 2 oz cream cheese until melted and combined. Season generously with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Simmer until thickened, 1-2 minutes, then remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once garlic and flatbreads are done, remove from oven and turn broiler to high.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully transfer garlic cloves to a cutting board and roughly chop.
        </li>
        <li>
            Evenly top flatbreads with white sauce, roasted garlic, veggies, and 1 oz mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>
            Broil flatbreads until cheese melts, 1-2 minutes, keeping a close eye on them so they don't burn.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice flatbreads into pieces and divide between plates.
        </li>
    </ol>
